# Artificial-Face-Generator-Using-DCGAN
The final project for my deep learning course at UoT. The project uses the Celebrity Attributes Images dataset to generate images of fake people. One of the major goals when working on this were to experiment which tuning parameters would yield the best quality images. I've tested parameters like Batch Size, Noise Array, number of Generator and Discriminator network layers and compared results using GAN loss functions.
