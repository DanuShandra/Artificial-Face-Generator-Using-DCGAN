# Artificial-Face-Generator-Using-DCGAN
The final project for my deep learning course at UoT. The project uses the Celebrity Attributes Images dataset to generate images of artificial faces. One of the major goals was to experiment which tuning parameters would yield the best image quality. Parameters like Batch Size, Noise Array, number of Generator and Discriminator network layers were tested and the results were compared using GAN loss functions.
